# 8th Light Technical Test
Created using Python 3 and Flask 0.12.2 and deployed via Heroku.

This app can be viewed at https://eighth-light-google-books-api.herokuapp.com/

The application allows you to do the following:
- [x] Type in a query and display a list of books matching that query.
- [x] Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.
- [x] From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.

## Set up

### **What's required**
This repo requires the following to run it smoothly on your local machine:

- Python 3.7.2 (or the latest version of Python https://www.python.org/)
- Flask 0.12.2 (or the latest version of Flask http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- Virtual Environment (handy if you don't want to set your global environment to use Python 3)
- pip (stands for "Pip Installs Packages" is a Python-specific package manager)

If you use Mac, you can install the latest version of Python 3 by doing `brew install python`. If you do not have Homebrew, run `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` in your command line. For more info, check out https://brew.sh/ (you're really missing out).

Check to see if you have Python installed on your local machine by running `python` in your command line. To check which version of Python you have, run `python --version` in your command line.

It should look like this:

If you have Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 installed on your machine, pip should be included in that package as well. If, for some reason, you don't have pip installed in your local machine, you can run `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py` followed by `python get-pip.py` in your command line. If you run into any issue installing pip, check out https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ or the holy grail [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pip) for more info ([Google](https://www.google.com/) is also my best friend).

### **More on virtual environment**
Python 3 was released on 12/2008 and sadly it's backwards-incompatible -- meaning, if you have a project that uses Python 2 and run it in a Python 3 environment, it will BREAK (same thing for the reverse scenario).

Virtual environment will solve that problem by creating isolated environments that run its own dependencies. For more information, take a look at [their documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or the more [fun version](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/).

### **Ok, so on to *actually* setting this thing up...**
Assuming that you don't have Python or any of this installed on your computer, here's what you need to do:

1. Open your command line/terminal (I use cmd + spacebar and type in "terminal")
2. `brew install python` and `brew link python` to symlink Python in Homebrew
3. Check Python version with `python --version` (make sure it's Python 3!)
4. `pip install virtualenv`
5. `python3 -m venv venv` 
    
    Note: the second venv can be whatever name you want the folder to be called  
6. `source venv/bin/activate`

   This will activate that particular venv and you should now see `(venv)` on the left side of the prompt. To deactivate it, just type in `deactivate`.

7. `pip install flask`
8. `git clone https://github.com/chieakiba/eighth-light-google-books-api.git`
9. `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
10. `export FLASK_APP=run.py`
11. `flask run`

And voil√°! Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and you should see the repo up and running on your browser.
