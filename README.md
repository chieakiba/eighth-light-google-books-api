# 8th Light Technical Test

Created using Python/Flask and deployed via Heroku
This app can be viewed at https://eighth-light-google-books-api.herokuapp.com/

The application allows you to do the following:
- [x] Type in a query and display a list of books matching that query.
- [x] Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.
- [x] From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.

### Next Steps
Things I can do to make this even better:
- [ ] Make it mobile responsive
- [ ] Make code more modular
- [ ] Add more comments
